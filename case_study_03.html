            Squabble: Voice Chat made Simple and Fun

        <h4 class="studysHead">Overview</h4>
            <p> 
                For an assignment based around user interaction and experience, I was tasked to design an app inspired by another app. This new app would have its own branding and improve upon the features that the inspiration lacked. I chose to create a voice chat app based on the app Discord using Figma as my chosen design tool.

    <h4 class="studysHead">Research</h4>
        <p> 
            Before designing any screens, I looked at how Discord's voice chat worked. Taking notes with Figma, I, along with some other testers, tested Discord's voice chat. While doing so, I picked out the features I wanted to add in my app to improve on it, and asked my testers their opinions on the features.

        <h4 class="studysHead">Rough Sketches + Branding</h4>
            <p>
                I started by sketching possible screens for my mobile app. I tried to focus on aspects of Discord that my testers agreed would be a necessary features such as the ability to see who is speaking on other screens and an easier way to see if someone is muted or deafened. My sketches were based on a few brand ideas I had in mind, which after some peer reviews, I went with my second set of designs, which was based around birds.

            <p>
                During this stage, I also started to come up with possible names, fonts, and color palettes for the app. For the color palette, I wanted to stick to neutral colors and with one accent color to keep things simple. The app eventually evolved to have more browns to further push the birds in a nest theme. While Discord is full of bright colors, I thought a more neutral palette could attract more people. As for fonts, I wanted to choose something that would be easy to read and a font that would fit the fun theme of the app. However, I simplified to just the Alegreya Sans font as the curly Supermercado font inhibited readability.

        <h4 class="studysHead">Iterations</h4>
            <p>
                My first prototype was created with visibility and usability in mind. I made text and buttons large so most users could read and tap them. I enlarged the buttons as they do exist on Discord but they are barely noticeable. I also simplified how the voice chat worked. I placed all the major buttons on the voice chat screen to make it easier to control. In addition, I added a visual element that shows  everyone inside the voice chat who is muted or if the person the voice chat muted. This is the egg overlay that sits over a person’s profile picture as seen below.

                Afterwards, I made sketches of what I wanted animated on the screen. These were to help give me a better idea of what could be done with my skillset. They ranged from simple animations, such as buttons jiggling to indicate that they have been pressed and screens sliding in, to the aforementioned egg animation. I initially did rough sketches of the main animations before using a prototype to outline all the animations I needed. Additionally on this page, I indicated all the motions that could be used on the app.

    <div>
        <h4 class="studysHead">Final Prototype</h4>
        <p>
            In the final iteration, I shrunk down the buttons and font to be a more reasonable size. While the larger size would be nice, if the text or buttons are too big, it could be overwhelming. This way, the user could focus on the most important buttons before seeing the other features on screen. Additionally, I made some of screens into overlays for a faster loading time of important features.

<div>
    <h4 class="studysHead">What I would do differently</h4>
        <p>
            If there is anything I would change, it would just be adding sound to the animations. The final prototype does work to show the functions of the app but I think adding some sound effects would enhance the experience. I would have also liked to tidy up a few buttons, such as some of the switches as they were buggy during the final iteration.
