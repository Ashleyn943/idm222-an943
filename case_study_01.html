    <h4 class="studysHead">Overview</h4>
        <p> 
            For a human-computer interaction class, I worked with 4 team members to redesign a website for better usability. This 3 week project focused on websites that failed many design principles introduced in the class. The team chose to redesign eBay because, as a whole, we found the website is overwhelming and does very little to help the users navigate between pages. First, the team created individual wireframes before coming together on Figma to polish and refine all the problems found on eBay's website.

    <h4 class="studysHead">Research</h4>
        <p>
            From our research, we found that eBay has been around since 1995. A lot of the old designs were clunky and distracting making them quite difficult for most users to navigate. While the current website is much better than the first one, it still fails to meet the design criteria successful products need. Considering its age, I centered my design choices around those with poor eyesight as that seemed to be the trend of improvement for eBay.

    <h4 class="studysHead">Individual Prototype</h4>
        <p>
            Individually, we created prototypes based on our own intuition before coming together to combine the best features. My prototype focuses on making items more visible. Following my target audience, I made the decision to increase the text size. The majority of eBay's font is set to 12px, which is quite small given the standard font size for a website is 16px. Additionally, I utilized the colors of eBay's logo to make sure everything can be seen. Text that remained on the smaller side were given color to help it stand out from the rest of the page. I also rearranged the layout to match the average shopping website. Websites, such Amazon, place persona options in the top right, so I moved the log in items to the top right. When all team members completed their redesigns, we brought them together to find the best features.

<div>
    <h4 class="studysHead">Group Prototype</h4>
        <p>
            Below, I featured both the original website and the teamâ€™s redesign. We all came to the consensus that the text size was too small and the entire website was overwhelming to look at. Text size was an easy fix as we could increase it. As for the overwhelming layout, we followed the principle of information hierarchy to fix it. We put all the products into their own boxes to give the users an easier viewing experience. Since eBay utilized this feature already, we copied the style and made sure everything matched. I was in charge of making sure the style and colored matched with eBay's brand. With the box system now in place, the overall design was much more concise and less overwhelming to look at.

    <h4 class="studysHead">What I would do differently</h4>
        <p>
            Given more time, I would have loved to redesign the footer of the page. While it is the standard footer, I wish we also made the text larger for viewing ease. I feel like we neglected the footer even though it is a major part of the website. Despite that, I believe the team did an excellent job redesigning the website.
