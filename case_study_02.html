        <h4 class="studysHead">Overview</h4>
            <p> 
                For a product design class, I worked with 3 team members to pitch a hypothetical multimedia product to resolve a problem currently impacting a community in the Philadelphia area. For this month-long project, our goal was to help educate people on how to properly recycle and encourage people to do it more. We researched using news articles and surveys to truly understand how audiences see the problem.
                <br><br>
                My job on the team was creating and designing the prototype for the mobile app using Figma. 
            </p>

    <div>
        <h4 class="studysHead">Research</h4>
            <p>
                We specifically narrowed our target audience to college students, as many students are now living on their own for the first time. Now that they were in charge of their own recycling, it would make them the perfect candidates to survey. The team conducted a survey around Drexelâ€™s campus to gather a diverse pool of answers. In the end, the majority of students had similar answers on their thoughts on recycling.
                <br><br>
                Most students said they lack knowledge when it comes to recycling and that they find it an inconvenience to recycle. They had no motivation to even do it properyly. Those three points became the starting block the possible solutions.

                <p class="caption">Survey results</p>
            <p>
                Alongside our survey, we also looked into apps and products that try to achieve a similar goals to ours. Additionally, we researched what motivates college students. Combining these inspirations, we started to brainstorm possible product designs.

        <h4 class="studysHead">Rough Sketches</h4>
            <p>
                The team created 20 different sketches and ideas for our product. Many of them ranged from different kinds of recycling bins to apps that make recycling enjoyable. We took the best ideas from these samples to create our final products. I mainly focused on creating sketches for the mobile app as that was my job on the team.

        <h4 class="studysHead">Final Prototype</h4>
            <p>
                This was the final design I came up with for the app. I used green and a neutral beige to give users an environmentally friendly look. Like a lot of other products that promote helping the environment. The app allows users to connect to a recycling bin and recycle the products correctly. They can scan the item and the app will tell users how to prep the item for recycling. This app also rewards the users with points that they can use to purchase items from a vending machine.

        <h4 class="studysHead">What I would do differently</h4>
            <p>
                I would take more time making the design cleaner. While it is a prototype, I think the cleaner environment aesthetic could be brought across clearer. I would also have liked to implement a way to make the features work on the prototype.
